# challenge-2021
ROS Project [Turtlebot]
In this project, we control a simulated and a real Turtlebot 3 burger mobile robot in a realistic challenging environment, so as to make it navigate from one starting position to a goal position with different tasks to solve on the path. The navigation should successively exploit: • images obtained from a simulated/real camera to detect and follow a line, • a laser scan obtained from a simulated/real LDS to detected and avoid some obstacles, • and finally both of them to navigate in a challenging environment where both sensors are required together. The project takes the form of 3 successive challenges relying on the sensorimotor capabilities of the turtlebot
